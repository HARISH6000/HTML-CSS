#  Interactive Multi-Page Website Simulator with CSS Only

Create a fully functional, multi-section website that simulates the experience of navigating between different pages—all without any JavaScript.

## Requirements
- Use the :target pseudo-class to display and hide different “pages” or sections of content.
- Incorporate CSS animations and transitions to simulate page transitions (such as fading or sliding effects).
- Design an accessible navigation menu that works across different devices and screen sizes.
- Ensure that the entire experience is responsive and leverages advanced CSS techniques (e.g., combining Flexbox, Grid, and pseudo-classes) to manage layout and state transitions.
